# Licences

This file lists the licence of each path and artifact. It is an engineering record, not
legal advice. For sources and hashes, read [docs/DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md). For the
reasons, read [ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-licence-clean-recipe-corpus.md).

## In git

| Path | Licence | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code and docs, unless listed below | MIT ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) | |
| `data/eval/curated_subs.json`, `data/eval/curated_diets.json` | MIT | Hand-written evaluation lists |
| `data/nutrition/dietary_labels.json` | MIT | Hand-written labels |
| `data/nutrition/aliases.json` | MIT, origin under review | Hand-written map to USDA ids, chosen by frequency in RecipeNLG. Unused in v1. Review at M9 |
| `docs/research/2026-10-stage1/` | MIT | Audit record. It holds counts, metrics and short ingredient phrases from RecipeNLG, and no recipes. `evidence/subs_out.json` is withheld, and git ignores it |

## Not in git

Git ignores `data/raw/`, `data/processed/` and `models/`.

None of these exist yet. Each one will appear in a manifest with its hash and licence.
