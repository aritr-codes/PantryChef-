# PantryChef

A person lists the ingredients they have. PantryChef is being built to show what they can
cook now and the one item that unlocks more. It uses conventional machine learning (ML),
information retrieval and deterministic logic. It uses no large language model (LLM) for
core features ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-no-llm-substitution.md)).

**Status: research code. The app does not exist yet.** The repo holds a tested Python
library and an audit of its own results. For the full state, read
[docs/PROJECT_STATE.md](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md). Licences: code is MIT, and data rules are
in [LICENSES.md](LICENSES.md).

## Built and planned

| Capability | Built | Planned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingredient parser | Rules plus vocabulary match: [`pantrychef/ingredients/parser.py`](pantrychef/ingredients/parser.py) | Unicode fractions, and tests on real lines (M1). A hand-labelled gold set (M2) |
| Search | Set-overlap baseline and the `cook` command: [`pantrychef/retrieval/`](pantrychef/retrieval/), [`pantrychef/cli.py`](pantrychef/cli.py) | One `answer()` function, with groups by missing items and top unlocking items (M1) |
| Ranking | Research only. A candidate pool and a LambdaMART ranker: [`pantrychef/recommender/`](pantrychef/recommender/). Only tests call its runtime | Ships only if it beats an IDF rule on hand-judged pantries (M4, [ADR 0005](docs/decisions/0005-honest-claims-and-eval-reset.md)) |
| Substitution | Graph and embedding arms, and the `substitute` command: [`pantrychef/substitution/`](pantrychef/substitution/). Mined from RecipeNLG, so it cannot ship | A curated table, and swaps mined from Open Recipes if they pass a blind rating (M5) |
| Dietary filter | Built, but not safe to rely on: [`pantrychef/dietary/`](pantrychef/dietary/). See [audit C2](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#c2-the-dietary-filter-is-unsafe-and-its-metric-cannot-fail-verified) | Three-state preference flags from a curated table, with no allergen claim (M5) |
| Nutrition | Built, not fit to show: [`pantrychef/nutrition/`](pantrychef/nutrition/). See [audit C3](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#c3-nutrition-output-is-not-fit-to-show-verified) | Stays out unless USDA FNDDS validation passes (M9) |
| Web app | None | A static site on GitHub Pages with a browser engine (M1, M6, [ADR 0004](docs/decisions/0004-static-first-browser-engine.md)) |
| Recipes for display | None. The research corpus is RecipeNLG, which never ships | Wikibooks Cookbook, CC BY-SA 4.0 (M1, [ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-licence-clean-recipe-corpus.md)) |
| Photo input | None | Tested later, and ships only if it passes a gate (M8) |
| Ingredient and recipe knowledge graph with ML on top | None | Proposed, not accepted ([ADR 0006](docs/decisions/0006-hybrid-graph-knowledge-base.md)) |

Milestones are in [docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).

## Results

An audit in October 2026 tested the old headline numbers. Many of them did not hold up.
The ledger is in [docs/PROJECT_STATE.md, section 7](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md#7-published-numbers),
and the details are in [docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md).

| Old claim | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Learned ranker beats the overlap baseline | Retracted as a quality claim. The task leaks the answer, and a no-ML rule scores close to the model ([audit C1](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#c1-the-recommender-headline-measures-the-query-generator-verified)) |
| Graph beats food2vec | Retracted as a headline. The 95% interval for the difference includes zero ([audit H1](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#h1-the-flagship-graph-model-does-not-yet-beat-its-baseline-verified)) |
| 100% dietary validity | Retracted. The check cannot fail ([audit C2](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#c2-the-dietary-filter-is-unsafe-and-its-metric-cannot-fail-verified)) |
| Nutrition coverage | Retracted. It used only the first rows of the file ([audit C3](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#c3-nutrition-output-is-not-fit-to-show-verified)) |
| Full-corpus ranker lead, and "saturates at 10k" | Retracted ([PROJECT_STATE, section 7](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md#7-published-numbers)) |
| Parser F1 and retrieval recall | Unsupported. No log exists ([PROJECT_STATE, section 7](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md#7-published-numbers)) |
| A production recommender bundle | False. The only bundle on disk holds 1,000 recipes ([audit H4](docs/TECHNICAL_AUDIT.md#h4-the-production-bundle-does-not-exist-verified)) |

New evaluation starts in M2. Each new number will link to a results file.

## Quickstart

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), then run these commands from the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest
uv run pantrychef --help
```

The tests need all extras, because some test files import `scipy` at module level.

The `cook` and `substitute` commands need data files that are not in git. For the steps,
read [docs/PROJECT_STATE.md, section 6](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md#6-what-a-person-can-run-today)
and [docs/DATASET.md](docs/DATASET.md).
